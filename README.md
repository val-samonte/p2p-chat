# p2p-trade-facilitator

### Objective

Create a dapp in Solana which will allow secured peer-to-peer (p2p) trading of tokens and fiat currencies by acting as a Trade Facilitator, similar to how Binance does their p2p, but decentralized and open sourced. 

### Case Study

It is hard to introduce cryptocurrency to other people because of the friction from trading fiat to crypto and vice versa. Centralized Exchange (CEX) such as Binance has been effective as a bridge for the people to get into cryptocurrency, however the centralized nature of it violates the ethos of decentralization.

GCash is still the de facto standard for digital money exchange in the Philippines. As the majority of small businesses already grasp the idea and the benefit of this tool due to the recent pandemic, it should be easier to introduce Solana to them as well, but only if we have a better tool to trade fiat and cryptocurrency.

### Challenge

The major reason this kind of dapp does not exist yet is because of trust: nobody wants to trade real money in exchange of cryptocurrency to a complete stranger. As per Binance, this is easily mitigated via Know Your Customer (KYC). Takers (the buyers) can easily appeal if the maker (the seller) has malicious intent, and vice versa.

### Solution

Introduce a tool which enables p2p exchange of fiat and cryptocurrency with escrow feature.

The dapp is governed by an active community (as Decentralized Organization / DAO). The DAO will act as a Trade Facilitator and will handle all issues that may arise from the protocol by conducting public hearings, proposing solutions, and voting for protocol improvements.

The dapp will gain revenue by adding a very small fee to every sell orders made by the sellers, and this revenue is distributed fairly to the participants of the dapp.

To promote transparency, the whole protocol will be open sourced, so that the community can spot bugs and can contribute easily.
